<H ALIGN="CENTER"><B><H2>Googley Choice Pamphlet</H2></B></H>
<br>
<p><FONT SIZE=5>This project shows the abilities I have in Canva. I am capable of making a pamphlet designed to represent a company and design it to attract the attention of users and business partners alike. My pamphlet includes a company address, company policies, a contact feature, company phone number, etc. I choose an appropriate color theme that would be unique to readers but not a headache to look at. I use many different other features to give the readers an incentive to read my pamphlet. This is just one example of the many possibilities I have to offer with Canva.</FONT></p>

<H ALIGN="CENTER"><B><H2>Googley Choice Website</H2></B></H>
<p><FONT SIZE=5>With the use of a website called “GoDaddy” I have made a website to represent a company named The Googley Choice which specializes with electronic devices. Using this I made an ecommerce website including the usual features such as the history of the company, a store, charity, policies, etc. I put my interests also into designing the website to attract customers, potential employees, and other companies that may want to interact with The Googley Choice. I am able to put the companies desires, or interests first while making the website and refine it to make the website the best it can be.</FONT></p>
