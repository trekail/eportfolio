<p align="center"><FONT SIZE=6>I feel that the fourth expectation "A SELF-DIRECTED, RESPONSIBLE, LIFE LONG LEARNER" fits well. Having to set goals for myself trying to improve my websites learning new coding on the way to those goals. I show flexability and adaptability by finding ways over my obstacles that I faced while making this website. I reflect on myself, my abilites in making a website, and improve on aspects that I may not of thought of earlier in the project. These are some reasons on how I believe that this project connects to the Catholic Graduate Expectations, specifically on the fourth expectation.</FONT></p>
